        <h2>What is web programming about?</h2>
        <p>Web programming is the process of creating web pages. During this process, the programmer is in charge of
            <strong>shaping the site</strong> according to the demands and needs of the company.<br>

            Although it is true that as a company, you can <srtong>decide on certain aspects of the site</srtong>, the
            programmer will be in charge of advising you so that the result is the best one possible.<br>

            This advice is given with the intention that the site not only meets the needs of the company, but also
            <strong>offers a good experience</strong> to users who enter. For the creation of the portal, programmers
            use
            <strong>different programming languages</strong> that are currently available on the market.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a programming language?</h2>
        <p>A programming language is <strong>a computer language</strong> that programmers use to create software. This
            way
            they are able to indicate to the programs the structure to be followed in order to make the process as safe
            as possible.<br>

            Nowadays, <strong>there are many programming languages</strong>, so the programmer is free to choose the one
            he/she feels most comfortable with, the one that best suits what he/she is asked to do.<br>

            One of the most widely used languages in web programming today is HTML5 as <strong>it’s compatible with
                the vast majority of computer browsers</strong> and mobile devices, such as smartphones.<br>

            The programming language <strong>allows you to set the structure of the website</strong>. Elements
            such as media files and fonts depend entirely on the language that is used.<br>

            Choosing the right language for your company’s website is an important task, as it’s one of the
            ways in which <strong>your customers can interact with you and your brand</strong>.</p>
